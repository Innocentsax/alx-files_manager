# Overview:
* This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

* The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images

## Testing and Jobs

A queueing job mechanism for creating thumbnails of photos uploaded to the application is included in the project. When a new user is created, it also leverages this feature to generate a welcome message. Bull is used in all of this.Â

Mocha is used in combination with Chai for testing the app.
